# INCO

This class is about exploring complexity and innovation through the lens of advanced interactive data visualization. Understanding how to co-evolve complex ecosystems and how to allow for distributed organizing to happen demands a thorough understanding of data visualization techniques. The course builds on basic knowledge in calculus and software development. It builds the basics for developing smart interactive web-based healthcare data displays.

- https://mpld3.github.io/


## Deliverables

- As part of the course you need to prepare an individual data visualization project based on publicly available healthcare dataset.
- The form of delivery is a two-tier architecture with a backend emitting fhir-compliant json and a frontend using d3.js to visualize and interact on the data.
